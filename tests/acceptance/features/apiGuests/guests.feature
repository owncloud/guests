Feature: Guests

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And using new dav path

#  @skipOnOcV10.3
#  Scenario Outline: Creating a guest user works fine
#    When the administrator creates guest user "<user>" with email "<email-address>" using the API
#    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
#    And user "<user>" should be a guest user
#    And the email address of user "<email-address>" should be "<email-address>"
#    Examples:
#      | email-address                  | user                 |
#      | guest@example.com              | guest                |
#      | John.Smith@email.com           | John.Smith           |
#      | betty_anne+bob-burns@email.com | betty_anne+bob-burns |
#
#
#  Scenario: Cannot create a guest if a user with the same email address exists
#    Given user "existing-user" has been created with default attributes and small skeleton files
#    And the administrator sends HTTP method "PUT" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/users/existing-user" with body
#      | key   | email             |
#      | value | guest@example.com |
#    When the administrator attempts to create guest user "guest" with email "guest@example.com" using the API
#    Then the HTTP status code should be "422"
#    And user "guest" should not exist
#
#
#  Scenario: A guest user cannot upload files to their own storage
#    Given the administrator has created guest user "guest" with email "guest@example.com"
#    And the HTTP status code should be "201"
#    When user "guest@example.com" uploads overwriting file "textfile.txt" from the guests test data folder to "/myfile.txt" with all mechanisms using the WebDAV API
#    Then the HTTP status code of all upload responses should be "401"
#    And the HTTP reason phrase of all upload responses should be "Unauthorized"
#    And as "guest@example.com" file "/textfile.txt" should not exist
#    And as "Alice" file "/textfile.txt" should not exist
#
#
#  Scenario: A guest user cannot upload files to their own storage (async upload)
#    Given the administrator has enabled async operations
#    And the administrator has created guest user "guest" with email "guest@example.com"
#    When user "guest@example.com" uploads file "textfile.txt" from the guests test data folder asynchronously to "/textfile.txt" in 3 chunks using the WebDAV API
#    Then the HTTP status code should be "401"
#    And as "guest@example.com" file "/textfile.txt" should not exist
#    And as "Alice" file "/textfile.txt" should not exist
#
#  @email @skipOnOcV10.3
#  Scenario Outline: A guest user can upload files to a folder shared with them
#    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and small skeleton files
#    And the administrator has created guest user "<user>" with email "<email-address>"
#    And the HTTP status code should be "201"
#    And user "Alice" has created folder "/tmp"
#    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/tmp" with guest user "<email-address>"
#    And guest user "<user>" has registered
#    When user "<email-address>" uploads file "textfile.txt" from the guests test data folder to "/tmp/textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
#    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
#    And as "Alice" file "/tmp/textfile.txt" should exist
#    Examples:
#      | email-address                  | user                 |
#      | guest@example.com              | guest                |

#    And the HTTP status code should be "201"
#    And user "Alice" has created folder "/tmp"
#    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/tmp" with user "guest@example.com"
#    And guest user "guest" has registered
#    When user "guest@example.com" creates a new chunking upload with id "chunking-42" using the WebDAV API
#    And user "guest@example.com" uploads new chunk file "1" with "AAAAA" to id "chunking-42" using the WebDAV API
#    And user "guest@example.com" uploads new chunk file "2" with "BBBBB" to id "chunking-42" using the WebDAV API
#    And user "guest@example.com" uploads new chunk file "3" with "CCCCC" to id "chunking-42" using the WebDAV API
#    And user "guest@example.com" moves new chunk file with id "chunking-42" to "/tmp/myChunkedFile.txt" using the WebDAV API
#    Then as "guest@example.com" file "/tmp/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
