guests 
=======

Create a guest user by typing his name in to the sharing dialog. The guest
will receive an email invite with a link to create an account. He has only access
to files which are shared with him.


Furthermore, the administrator has to whitelist the applications that guests can use.
By default ',core,settings,avatar,files,files_trashbin,files_versions,files_sharing,files_texteditor,activity,firstrunwizard,gallery' are allowed.
The initial `,` is necessary to allow access to root resources.
